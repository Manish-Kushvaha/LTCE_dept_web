      <h2>Geeky Devolution Coding Club</h2>
      <p>
      <h4>22nd September, 2022</h4>
      <p>The CSI council of Lokmanya Tilak College of Engineering (LTCE) recently
        launched Geeky</p>

      <p>
        Devolution, the first ever coding club of the college. The club was founded
        with the aim of helping students hone their programming skills and build up
        their knowledge base. The program was presented by the Computer Science
        and Information (CSI) Council, and was launched with the support and
        cooperation of the college faculty and administration. To join the club,
        students must demonstrate their programming and coding proficiency, as well
        as their knowledge of computer science, general IT, and related fields.
        The primary focus of Geeky Devolution is to provide a platform for students
        to learn and explore the world of coding and the club encourages students to
        number of seminars, workshops, and hackathons to help students gain
        experience and hone their programming skills. Some of the topics covered in
        the seminars include web development, app development, data science, and
        machine learning. The hackathons, meanwhile, allowed participants to work
        on their own projects and showcase their coding skills. Overall, Geeky
        Devolution's launch by the CSI Council of LTCE was a huge success. It
        provided students with an invaluable opportunity to learn programming,
        network with industry professionals, and find job opportunities.
